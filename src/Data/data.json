        "content": ["Hi! I have always been curious about the stuff that revolutionises the way people live, think and breathe. I remember the time, I was still a school kid when my dad brought the first mobile phone in our home. Thinking back, if mobiles had never been invented, never reached us, we would still be indifferent about the sheer existence of such a device, and would function normally as a society, but, now we can not imagine our lives without one.",
            "This had a lasting impact on me. Tech can change the world in ways people might not even imagine. With a passion to create change in society for betterment, I studied Industrial Design, in my undergrad, from National Institute of Technology (N.I.T.), Rourkela, which allowed me to explore quantitative and computational subjects. This in turn amplified my interest in computation, economics and human behaviour.",
            "Having worked with technologies like Augmented Reality (AR), 3D modelling and User Research, I currently work at the intersection of mathematics, Tech and finance with help of blockchain, which I feel, can revolutionalize modern financial systems."],
